    //- p The spaces that we - and all other life - inhabit have subtle and profound affects on our lives. 
    p All life is guided by its environment and subtle changes in spaces can have profound effects. Architectural generative design is the practice of using software to assist with the design of buildings so that they may be 'better' for the either the environment, developer or future inhabitants.  Despite the appeal, #[i how] to make it better and #[i what] kind of better and for #[i whom] are rarely clear. Here, the #[i what] and #[i who] are radically simplified since we can simulate the life completely and the focus is on the #[i how]. Essentially, it is the most simple but pure generative architecture project possible.

    H2 Methods
    p This project was an opportunity to experiment with spatial optimization methods. The simplicity of this problem makes it a useful test environment, but also illustrates how algorithms always have their own biases and impact output designs as much as metrics or datasets. All methods were averaged over 5 runs with 80,000 evaluations and the same starting seed.

    p  CMA-ES latent evolution did best but the difference was close enough that it could be made up with meta-parameter tuning. Machine learning methods may be very powerful for organizing search spaces for exploration. However, this 'smoothness' corresponds to a decrease in resolution. This is evident in the  above images where the direct evolution had a hard time cleaning up certain details but was able to produce more diverse forms. Remarkably, they still managed to produce a near-equal average fitness. 

    p Evolution in latent space has other nice properties not fully evident here. It is capable of producing a crossover operator and arbitrarily large mutations where none might exist (such as #[a(href='/evo_floorplans.html') floor-plans] or #[a(href='https://www.antimander.org') congressional districts]), the ability to define the design space via examples and the performance benefits of a smaller search space.

    p CPPN's are attractive for their capacity to create novelty unburdened by datasets. However, the shapes bias towards simpler geometric shapes defined by the node operators and most runs stayed stuck in the local optimum of a circle. 
    
    h2 Implementation 
    p.centered: a(href='https://github.com/joel-simon/FormsOfLife') Source
    p The code is written in Python and uses Pytorch (for ML models), #[a(href='https://cython.org/') Cython] (for image operators) and #[a(href='https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi') Taichi] (for running GOL in Cuda). These enable extremely efficient but also highly compact and readable code. Two-hundred GOl boards can be run in parallel for 1000 steps in a fraction of a second and a whole optimization run takes just a few minutes. The GA uses #[a(href='https://pymoo.org/') pymoo] and the evolutionary strategy uses #[a(href='https://github.com/CMA-ES/pycma') pycma]. The WebGL viewers use #[a(href='http://regl.party/') regl].
    
    //- p How would other artificial life to live? and who will design it for them?
    h2 Future Work
    p Broadening the imagination for artificial life is a goal, and there are several other AL domains where it is fun to imagine how they might want to live and what their architecture and communities could look like. For improved spatial optimization, hybrid latent-direct methods that can leverage the advantage of both is exciting. Additionally, incorporating fitness into the ML models and applying it to other generative design problems is a current area of my research.
