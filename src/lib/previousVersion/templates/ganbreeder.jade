    p Ganbreeder is a collaborative art tool for discovering images. Images are 'bred' by having children, mixing with other images and being shared via their URL. This is an experiment in using breeding + sharing as methods of exploring high complexity spaces. GAN's are simply the engine enabling this. Ganbreeder is very similar to, and named after, #[a(href='http://picbreeder.org/') Picbreeder]. It is also inspired by an earlier project of mine #[a(href='http://www.joelsimon.net/facebook-graffiti.html') Facebook Graffiti] which demonstrated the creative capacity of crowds. Ganbreeder uses #[a(href='https://tfhub.dev/deepmind/biggan-128/2') these] BigGAN models and the #[a(href='https://github.com/joel-simon/ganbreeder') source code] is available.

            |  A tool for discovering images via breeding and sharing in-browser. I feel the combination of latent spaces with collaborative interactive evolution has a lot of potential as a design tool. Essentially picbreeder powered by
