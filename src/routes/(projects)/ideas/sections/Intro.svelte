  <b>New Collabs</b> is a research project combining open-ended evolutionary (OEE)
  algorithms with large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate ideas for collaborations.
  It presents a novel algorithm for open-ended ideation using co-evolved creative-chain-of-thought
  (ccot) templates. The algorithm is tested with principled divergent creative thinking
  templates applied to scraped bios of friends of the author mixed with some well
  known artists.

  The creative motivation is to explore whether the internet - and the LLMs
  trained on it - offer new opportunities for human creative collaborations,
  inverting the usual dynamic of internet scraping taking our data to train
  models to one where LLMs can give back to us. The technical motivation is to
  investigate if open-ended evolutionary algorithms can complement LLMs and
  produce genuinely surprising novelty. The philosophical motivation is not to
  determine whether 'AI' can automate human creativity - a question that is
  deemed inhumane - but rather to inspire humans with possible directions for
  them to continue and fuel their own creativity, and potentially even foster
  new creative relationships.
