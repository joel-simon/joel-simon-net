  <!-- When you ask
    ChatGPT to create something the results tend to be conventional and lack
    diversity.  -->
  <p>
    Large Language Models (LLMs) generate coherent text but tend to produce
    homogeneous outputs when prompted for creative content. To overcome this, I
    introduce Lluminate, an LLM based evolutionary algorithm that explores
    diverse creations by combining evolutionary methods with principled creative
    thinking strategies. The findings demonstrate that integrating evolutionary
    pressure with formalized creative strategies enables sustained open-ended
    exploration (illumination) of latent creative spaces, offering new
    possibilities for assisted creative exploration, countering homogenization,
    and perhaps even enabling the discovery of new ideas.

  Large Language Models (LLMs) generate coherent text but tend to produce
  homogeneous outputs when prompted for creative content. This work introduces
  Lluminate, an evolutionary algorithm based on reasoning LLMs that aims to
  explore teh full space (illumination).
   algorithm systematically explores the
  creative boundaries of LLMs (illuminates) across multiple domains, producing
  significantly more diverse and novel outputs compared to direct prompting. -->
  <!-- <p>
    AI-generated content often feels predictable and homogeneous. For tasks like
    proofreading or summarizing this is sufficient, but limiting for creative
    tasks. This is because language models are trained to produce the most
    likely or average response based on their training data. In this research, I
    introduce Lluminate - a new algorithm a for open-ended discovery and
    exploration (illumination) to help LLMs break free from these patterns.
    Lluminate combines evolutionary algorithms with large language models (LLMs)
    and infuses them with creative thinking strategies borrowed from human
    psychology.

  <!-- <p>
    Lluminate works by: Generating diverse ideas using an LLM (like GPT-4)
    Measuring how different each idea is from others Selecting the most novel
    ideas to build upon Applying creative thinking strategies like "conceptual
    blending" or "assumption reversal" Evolving ideas over generations to
    explore new creative possibilities

    This research introduces Lluminate, an algorithm for open-ended discovery
    and exploration (illumination). It is a evolutionary algorithm based on
    reasoning based large language models (LLMs) that combines self-reflection
    and creative thinking strategies from psychology. The goal is to both probe
    the creative boundaries of LLMs and explore new possibilities for assisted
    creative exploration. It also introduces the idea of evolvable creative
    thinking strategies for LLM. Below I demonstrate experiments across multiple
    domains as well as ablation studies, the results of which shed some light on
    the the creative process of LLMs.
