By combining Janelle Shane's expertise in AI and machine learning with Jenny Holzer's mastery of public art and provocative text, we could create a global installation that learns from and responds to human emotions in real-time, translating them into a universal visual language that evolves based on collective input and cultural context.\n\nNow, I'll present the idea in the requested format:\n\n```json {\n    \"IDEA_SUMMARY\": \"A global network of AI-powered emotion translators capture and interpret human feelings, converting them into an evolving visual language displayed on public surfaces worldwide.

Specifically, there is little exploration of wearable technology that augments live, AI-generated music performances, thereby creating an immersive, responsive experience.\n\n2. **Share individual epistemic agency:**\n   Both creators have unique expertise\u2014Virj Kan in wearable computing and interactive bio-design, and Dadabots in AI-generated music. They can bring together their skills to investigate how biodesign and AI can co-create emotive, real-time, and responsive performance art.\n\n3. **Converge on collective cognitive responsibility:**\n   Focus on generating a shared, real-time performance experience where the wearable technology and AI-generated music respond dynamically to both the performer's and the audience's physiological data. This convergence can enhance and personalize the live performance experience significantly.\n\n4. **Craft knowledge-advancing questions:**\n   - How can bio-sensing wearables be utilized to inform and manipulate AI-generated music in real-time?\n   - What kinds of interactive interfaces can create meaningful engagement between performers, audience, and AI?\n   - How can the combination of these technologies advance our understanding of human-machine interaction?\n\n5. **Design progressive discourse methodologies:**\n   Utilize iterative testing and development with a focus group consisting of both musicians and non-musicians to refine the integration between bio-sensing wearables and AI music generation. Implement a series of workshop sessions to prototype various interaction models and gather feedback.\n\n6. **Engage in collaborative idea improvement:**\n   Both creators should iterate on their design concepts based on workshop feedback, incorporating diverse input to evolve the functionality and aesthetics of the wearable interface and the generative music algorithms. Collaboration with a live performance setting for testing these models can yield practical improvements.\n\n7. **Embrace emergent conceptual artifacts:**\n   Develop prototypes that showcase the evolving integration between the wearables and the AI music system. These prototypes should be documented and analyzed for how well they achieve the goal of real-time, interactive engagement.\n\n8. **Manifest a community knowledge breakthrough:**\n   Present the final project in a public performance setting, allowing live interaction and data collection to further the understanding of the audience's engagement and the performer's experience. Publish a detailed study on the findings to provide insights into the next generation of interactive performance art technologies.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"FORMAT\": [\"performance\", \"installation\"],\n    \"IDEA_SUMMARY\": \"An interactive performance experience where real-time biosensor data from wearables on both performers and audience members influences AI-generated music.
