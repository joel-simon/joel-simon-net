        # Evolving Alien Corals Video
        An animation of my [generative corals research](/corals.html) made by [Nic Symbios](http://www.symbios.wiki/) and myself. This work was a finalist in the 2019 [virtual creatures competition](https://virtualcreatures.github.io/) held at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO). The competition is the intersection of artificial life research and art. Nic did all of the wonderful animation and rending.
