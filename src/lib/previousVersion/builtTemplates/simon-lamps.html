<p>Simon Lamps (dot com) is a separate website for my lamps. I wanted it to reflect that they are visually cohesive and distinct from my other work.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/simon-lamps/simon-lamps-2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>My goals were to show both the photos of exiting lamps and also the connectedness of the designs. Specifically, each lamp is a curve around a box, and there are several types of lamps that come from different orientations of the box.</p>
<p>This is perhaps best seen in the collection of 3D sketches I have made.</p>
<p><img src="/imgs/simon-lamps/lamps2017.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I wanted to incorporate this models to show the designs &#39;pure&#39; and capture all the angles not possible in the photos. Initial designs had these models featured prominently in the UI. Here is a very early prototype using only 3D models with somewhat of a Brady Bunch look.</p>

      </video><br><p>I experimented with multiple inputs to 3D navigation that were also compatible with mobile (including not very good ideas such as phone tilting). Eventually I decided the models had to be supplementary. They could be distracting and would never perform very well on all mobile devices. I ended up using simplified views to demonstrate the commonalities. The bottom navigation tried to convey how each lamp is just a curve.</p>

<p>The models became tied the vertical scroll which allowed them to be embedded on a scrolling page on mobile.</p>
