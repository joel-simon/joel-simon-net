    h1 Artbreeder Interviews
    //- h2
    p I interviewed members of the Artbreeder community about how they are thinking about and using machine learning and Artbreeder in their creative practices. Specifically, on the topics of collaboration, exploration and technical transparency. This was for a show at the Arebyte gallery (https://www.arebyte.com/real-time-constraints.) which was viewable via a chrome extension in 2020. The edited interviews are visualized by a generative animation driven by the users images.
